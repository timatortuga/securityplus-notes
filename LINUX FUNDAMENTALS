LINUX FUNDAMENTALS 

LOGGING INTO A LINUX MACHINE-
_____________________________________
  The command to do so is ssh and then the username of the account, @ the IP address of the machine.
EX: ssh tryhackme@MACHINE_IP or ssh tryhackme@10.10.155.94

Then you'll  be prompted for the password. You may not see your text written out 
continue writing the event if characters are hidden, give the system a moment to load  



QUICK CHEAT CODE COMMANDS
_____________________________________
ls and find and navigating the filesystem using cd. 

In this task, we're going to learn some more commands for interacting with the filesystem to allow us to:

create files and folders
move files and folders
delete files and folders


More specifically, the following commands:

Command	Full Name	Purpose
touch	touch	Create file
mkdir	make directory	Create a folder
cp	copy	Copy a file or folder
mv	move	Move a file or folder
rm	remove	Remove a file or folder
file	file	Determine the type of a file



Downloading Files (Wget)
____________________________
wget .  This command allows us to download files from the 
web via HTTP -- as if you were accessing the file in your browser. 
We simply need to provide the address of the resource

Below, the file is named "myfile.txt" 
EX: wget https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/linux-fundamentals/part3/myfile.txt


Transferring Files From Your Host - SCP (SSH)
Secure copy= SCP (Securely transfering files via the SSH protocol)
Working on a model of SOURCE and DESTINATION, SCP allows you to:

Copy files & directories from your current system to a remote system
Copy files & directories from a remote system to your current system

EX to COPY FROM OUR MACHINE TO A REMOTE MACHINE
      ______________________________________________
scp important.txt 
ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/transferred.txt

BREAKDOWN:
scp important.txt ...
Name of the file on the local system	important.txt 

scp important.txt 
ubuntu@192.168.1.30...
The IP address of the remote system 	192.168.1.30

scp important.txt 
ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/...
User on the remote system	ubuntu

scp important.txt 
ubuntu@192.168.1.30:/home/ubuntu/transferred.txt ...
Name that we wish to store the file as on the remote system

EX to COPY FROM A REMOTE MACHINE TO OUR MACHINE
      _____________________________________________
scp ubuntu@192.168.1.30:
/home/ubuntu/documents.txt notes.txt 




Serving Files From Your Host - WEB
__________________________________
Ubuntu machines come pre-packaged with python3.
    Module is called "HTTPServer". 
    This module turns your computer into a quick and easy web 
    server that you can use to serve your own file.

EX:python3 -m  http.server 
tryhackme@linux3:/webserver# python3 -m http.server
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...

Let's use wget to download the file using the 10.10.9.65 address and the name of the file.
          ____                                __________________
EX:
tryhackme@mymachine:~# wget http://10.10.9.65:8000/myfile

NOTE: Once you start the Python3 web server, 
      it will run in that terminal until you cancel it.
